This project is a reimplementation in Ruby on Rails of the Module Catalogue used at the University of Wales Swansea. It is a student project that will be developed using open source techniques. This project is an extension of Rob Tully's 2006-2007 project _Agile Development with Ruby on Rails_.

From this year's project description:

With the help of input from Administrative Staff, Students and Academics, this project will develop Rob Tully's work to a form that could be **deployed** in the School of Engineering from the start of the 2008 academic year.

Typical use cases could include (but are not restricted to):
  * On-line display of module descriptions.
  * On-line editing of module descriptions by authorized staff.
  * On-line maintenance of program structures and optional modules by Program Directors and   their assistants.
  * Linking module descriptions to annual safety and risk assessment.
  * Program maintenance and annual review.
  * Automated production of handbooks.
  * Custom staff and student timetables.
  * Inputs to timetabling.
  * Module, program, student and staff oriented views of reading lists.
  * Links to course documents and blackboard resources.
  * Easy access to databases of past examination papers.

There will be ample scope for website design, developing in a distributed open source environment, as well as an opportunity to learn more about the Ruby on Rails web application framework.
